
ToolShed is a package of utilities to perform cross-development from Windows,
Linux or Mac OS X computers to the Tandy Color Computer and Dragon
microcomputers.

== QUICK INSTALL (LINUX and macOS) ==

The easiest way to install ToolShed on Linux or macOS is to use the included
installation script. This script will attempt to install any missing 
dependencies (like FUSE) and then build and install the tools.

From the root of the Toolshed directory, run:
$ ./install.sh


== HOW TO BUILD ON WINDOWS ==

The recommended build environment is MingW32 or MingW64 (http://mingw.org/),
MSYS2 (http://msys2.github.io/), or the WSL subsystem (for Windows 10+)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

The easiest way to install MingW is using a mingw-get-inst.*.exe from
http://mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started

Inside MingW, make sure you have "make" installed. There are several options,
but the simpler mingw-make should be good enough:
$ mingw-get install mingw-make

Enter the unpackaged toolshed directory and run:
$ make -C build/unix install CC=gcc

== HOW TO BUILD FOR WINDOWS ON UNIX or WSL ==

$ NOTEST=1 make -C build/unix CC="x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -Wl,--force-exe-suffix"

== HOW TO BUILD ON UNIX ==

To build cocofuse (LINUX only) you will need to have FUSE libraries and
header files installed. On Debian-based systems:
$ sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

Enter the unpackaged toolshed directory and run:
$ make -C build/unix install


== HOW TO BUILD hdbdos and dwdos ==

It is recommended to have lwtools installed (http://lwtools.projects.l-w.ca/).
You will also need "makewav" from Toolshed installed to build WAV files.
See hdbdos/README.txt and the makefiles for different build options.

To build all default flavors:
$ make -C dwdos
$ make -C hdbdos
$ make -C superdos

Instead of lwtools the deprecated mamou can still be used (YMMV):
$ make -C dwdos AS="mamou -r -q"
$ make -C hdbdos AS="mamou -r -q"
Note that superdos still builds with mamou by default.
