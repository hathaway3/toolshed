Year/Mo/Da - Who        - Discription of Changes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013/02/01 - David Ladd - Updated hdbdos.asm so that when building for becker
                          port the text in the startup of HDBDOS will say
                          BECKER rather then DW3.

2013/01/23 - David Ladd - Updated dwread.asm and dwwrite.asm so that the 6309
                          code was in the 6309 labeled area and moved the
                          6809 57600bps code to the default area.  Also fixed
                          a ENDC that was in the wrong location.

2013/01/22 - David Ladd - Updated dwread.asm and dwwrite.asm to include the
                          ARDUINO into the IFEQ BECKER+JMCPBCK to now make
                          it IFEQ BECKER+JMCPBCK+ARDUINO

2013/01/03 - David Ladd - Updated makefile to correct for a typo related to
                          Becker and J&M CP FDC's routines.  Also fixed
                          Becker routine and added J&M CP FDC's routines back
                          into the dwread.asm and dwwrite.asm files after a
                          accidental overwrite.
 
2012/12/04 - David Ladd - Updated makefile to compile the new Becker and J&M
                          CP FDC's parallel port routines.

2012/12/02 - David Ladd - Duplicated Becker code in both dwread.asm and
                          dwwrite.asm files and changed the ports. This is to
                          allow use of the parallelport of the J&M CP FDC to
                          interface with a DLP-USB245M FT245BM Demo Board.

2012/11/13 - David Ladd - Fixed Becker read routine related to stack
