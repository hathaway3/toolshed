# HDB-DOS

HDB-DOS is a hard disk operating system for the Color Computer.

## Flavours

- **.rom files**: Used for replacing the ROM in a disk controller.
- **.bin files**: DECB binaries that can be copied to a DECB floppy and chain-loaded.
- **.wav files**: Allow loading HDB-DOS via cassette.

The difference between `_cc1` and `_cc2` flavours is the baud rate.

## Building

The `hdbdos` build depends on equates generated by `cocoroms`, so build `cocoroms` first.

```bash
make -C cocoroms
make -C hdbdos
```

See the `hdbdos/Makefile` for more hints about different flavours and build options.
