This is version 1.1 of Copt2.  I have added a few new interesting things.
Copt2 now supports the notion of tags.  The previous version used
"cascading patterns" to do some of the things that can now be done with
tags.  Tags can be very powerful.  They allow information about register
usage to propagate around so that more optimizations can be performed.
Some non-local optimizations can be performed using this technique that
could not be performed by normal peephole optimizations.  The trade off,
unfortunately, is in speed.  With a lot of tag informatinon being
propogated around, optimization time can increase quite a bit.  Seperate
pattern files can be made to do different levels of optimization.

Also in this archive is a new program called rmxlab (remove extra labels).
All it does is take out unused local labels in the assembler file.  The
files generated by MW C can have a lot of extra unused labels in them
that hinder optimization.  This program is very fast and can help quite
a bit in some cases.

The source code for copt2 now consists of two files - copt2.c and expr.c.
