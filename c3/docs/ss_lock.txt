.sh NAME

_ss_lock - set file lock status
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
int _ss_lock(path, locksize)
int path;
long locksize;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db \fBSS_LOCK\fP locks out a section of a file open on \fIpath\fP from the current file
position up to the number of bytes specified by \fIlocksize.\f
.sp
If the locksize is zero, all locks (record lock, EOF lock, and file lock)
are removed. If a locksize of 0xFFFFFFFF is requested, the entire file is
locked regardless of where in the file the file pointer is. This is a special
type of file lock that remains in effect until released by \fI_ss_lock(path,0),\fP a read or write of zero or more bytes, or the file is closed.
.sp
If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and the error code is
placed in the global variable \fIerrno.\f
