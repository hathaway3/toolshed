_ss_pfd -- set and write file descriptor
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
#include <direct.h>

int _ss_pfd(path, buffer)
int path;
struct fildes *buffer;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db \fBSS_PFD\fP will copy certain bytes from the buffer pointed to by \fIbuffer\fP into the file descriptor sector of the file opened on \fIpath.\fP The buffer is usually obtained from the \fBGS_GFD\fP function. Only the owner ID, the modification date,
and the creation date is changed.
.sp
The structure \fIFILDES\fP declared in \fBDIRECT.H\fP provides a convenient means to access the file descriptor information.
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
The buffer must be at least 16 bytes long or garbage could be written into
the file descriptor sector. The owner ID field can be changed only by the
super-user. It is impossible to change the file attributes with the call.
Instead, use the \fBSS_ATTR\fP function.
