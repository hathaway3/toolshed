.sh DESCRIPTION
.db \fBSS_SSIG\fP sets up a signal to be sent to the calling process when an interactive
device has data ready. When data is received on the device indicates by \fIpath,\fP the signal \fIsigcode\fP is sent to the calling process.
.sp \fBSS_SSIG\fP must be called each time the signal is sent if it is to be used again.
.sp
The device is considered busy, and will return an error, if any read request
arrives before the signal is sent. Write requests are allowed to the device
while in this state.
.sp
If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and the error code is
placed in the global variable \fIerrno.\f
