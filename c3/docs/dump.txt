.sh DESCRIPTION

starting at the memory address pointed to by \fIaddr,\fP dumps exactly \fIcount\fP bytes to the fp
file pointer.

.sh NOTE
.db
Care must be taken to insure the variable \fIcount\fP is not too large, else the
memory dump will take a very long time. Also, the dump is formatted similar
to the standard OS9 dump utility.
