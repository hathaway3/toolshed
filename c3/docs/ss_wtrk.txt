.sh NAME
.bb
_ss_wtrk - write a disk drive track
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
int _ss_wtrk(path, trkno, siden, trkbuf)
int path;
int trkno, siden
char *trkbuf
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db \fBSS_WRTK\fP performs a write-track operation on a disk drive. It is essentially
a direct hook into the driver's write-track entry point.
.sp
The argument \fIpath\fP is the path on which the device is opened. \fITrkno\fP is the desired track number to write, and \fIsiden\fP is the desired side of the disk on
which to write. When the write is performed, the image contained in and
pointed to by \fItrkbuf\fP is written out to the disk.
.sp
If an error occurs, \fB_SS_WTRK\fP returns the value -1 and the error code is
placed in the global variable \fIerrno.\f
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
This function works only on \fBRBF\fP devices. Additional information on how it
works can be obtained from examining the \fBFORMAT\fP utility or a device driver.
Also, note there is a difference in the syntax of this call from that used in
OSK systems.

If the variable \fItrkno\fP is set to zero when this function is called,
the \fBENTIRE\fP disk, floppy or hard disk, will be formatted. Care should be
taken to insure that \fItrkno\fP has a non-zero value prior to entering this function.
