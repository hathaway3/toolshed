l3tol, ltol3 - convert between 3-byte integers and long integers

.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
void l3tol (lp, cp, n)
long *lp;
char *cp;
int n;
.sp
void ltol3 (cp, lp, n)
char *cp;
long *lp;
int n;

.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The \fBL3TOL\fP subroutine converts a list of \fIn\fP three-byte integers packed into a character string
pointed to by  \fIcp\fP into a list of long integers pointed to by \fIlp.\fP
.pp
The \fBLTOL3\fP performs the reverse conversion from long integers \fIlp\fP to three-byte integers \fIcp.\fP
.pp
These functions are useful for file-system maintenance
where the block numbers are three bytes long. Certain disc addresses are
maintained in three-byte form rather than four-bytes.
.ed
.sh CAVEATS
.db
Because of possible differences in byte ordering,
the numerical values of the long integers are machine-dependent.
