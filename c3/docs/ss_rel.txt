.sh DESCRIPTION
.db \fBSS_REL\fP cancels the signal to be sent from a device on data ready. The function \fBSS_SSIG\fP enables a device to send a signal to a process when data is available
on the device. If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and the
appropriate error value is placed in the global variable \fIerrno.\f
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
The signal request is also canceled when the issuing process dies or closes
the path to the device. This feature exists only on \fBSCF\fP devices.
