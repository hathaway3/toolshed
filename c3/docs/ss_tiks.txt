.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
int _ss_tiks(path, tickcnt)
int path;
int tickcnt;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
If a read or write request is made for a part of a file that is locked out by
another user, \fBRBF\fP normally sleeps indefinitely until the conflict is removed. \fBSS_TIKS\fP may be used to cause an error (E$Lock) to be returned to the process
if the conflict still exists after a specific number of clock ticks have
elapsed.
.sp
The argument \fItickcnt\fP specifies the number of ticks to wait if the record-lock
conflict occurs with the file open on \fIpath.\fP A tick count of zero (the default on \fBRBF\fP devices), causes a sleep until the record is released. A tick count of
one means if the record is not released immediately, an error is to be
returned.
.sp
If an error occurs, \fB_SS_TIKS\fP returns the value -1 and the error code is
placed in the global variable \fIerrno.\f

This feature exists only on \fBRBF\fP devices.
