The Mamou Assembler
-------------------

1. Origin

The Mamou Assembler is a full featured Motorola 6809/Hitachi 6309 assembler. It supports the entire instruction set of both processors.

Mamou uses a two-pass process when assembling source files. In the first pass, symbol information is collected and the source is checked for syntactical correctness. In the second pass, unresolved symbols are resolved and code is actually created.
