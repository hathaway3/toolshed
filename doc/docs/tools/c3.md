# c3 (C-Cubed C Compiler)

`c3` is the executive for the C-Cubed project, a cross-hosted version of the Microware C compiler for the Color Computer and Dragon systems. It coordinates the pre-processor, compiler mainline, optimizer, assembler (`rma`), and linker (`rlink`).

## Usage
`c3 [opts] [files] [opts]`

### Options
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a` | Compile to assembler source files (`.a`) |
| `-c` | Leave comments in the generated assembler source |
| `-d<name>` | Define a name for the preprocessor |
| `-u<name>` | Undefine a predefined name |
| `-r[=<dir>]` | Compile/assemble to relocatable files (`.r`). Optionally specify a target directory. |
| `-o` | Don't run the object code improver (optimizer) |
| `-s` | Disable runtime stack checking |
| `-e=<n>` | Set the edition number for the output module |
| `-m=<n>[K]` | Set additional memory for the stack in the output module |
| `-f=<name>` | Set the output file name |
| `-n=<name>` | Set the output module name |
| `-l=<name>` | Search additional library |
| `-v=<dir>` | Search directory for preprocessor `< >` includes |
| `-t=<dir>` | Set directory for temporary files |
| `-x` | Cause compiler to use traps for math library calls |
| `-y` | Don't add `cstart.r` and standard libraries |
| `-q` | Quiet mode (don't output command names) |
| `-i` | Verbose mode (output exact commands executed) |
| `-p` | Output pre-processor listing (passed to c3comp) |

### Environment Variables
