# cocofuse

`cocofuse` enables mounting CoCo disk images as local filesystems on Linux and macOS using FUSE.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux**: Requires `libfuse-dev`.
- **macOS**: Requires `macfuse` (can be installed via Homebrew).

## Usage

Highly useful for seamless interaction between the host OS and disk images, allowing you to use standard file management tools (like `cp`, `ls`, `rm`) directly on the mounted image.
