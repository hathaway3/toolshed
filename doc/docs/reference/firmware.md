# ToolShed Firmware & ROMs

ToolShed includes source code and build systems for several CoCo and Dragon firmware projects, including original system ROMs and custom DOS implementations.

## Core System ROMs (`cocoroms`)

The `cocoroms` directory contains the assembly source for original Tandy Color Computer and Dragon ROMs.
- **Components**: Color BASIC (`bas.asm`), Extended Color BASIC (`extbas.asm`), CoCo 3 ROM (`coco3.asm`), Disk BASIC (`disk.asm`), and Dragon equivalents.
- **Usage**: These are typically used as a base for custom ROMs or for use in emulators.

## Custom DOS & Extensions

### HDB-DOS (`hdbdos`)
A powerful extension to Disk BASIC that supports hard drive images and SD card interfaces.
- **Baud Rates**: Available in different flavors (e.g., `_cc1` and `_cc2`) with different baud rate settings.
- **Formats**: Builds as `.rom` (for controller replacement), `.bin` (DECB binaries), and `.wav` (cassette loading).
- **Note**: This build depends on equates generated by `cocoroms`.

### DriveWire DOS (`dwdos`)
Specialized DOS for booting NitrOS-9 or other software over a DriveWire connection instead of a physical floppy.
- **Function**: Works similarly to the RSDOS `DOS` command but loads via serial/DriveWire.
- **Formats**: Builds as `.rom` (motherboard or controller replacement), `.bin` (DECB binary), and `.trk` (boot track format).

### SuperDOS (`superdos`)
A disassembled and enhanced version of the original DragonDOS, ported to various hardware.
- **Ports**: Supports Dragon 32, Dragon 64, Dragon Alpha, and Tano Dragon/RS-DOS.
- **Build Targets**: Use `make all`, `make alpha`, `make ddos`, etc.
- **Note**: Still uses the `mamou` assembler by default.

## Build Recommendations

It is highly recommended to have **LWTOOLS** installed for most of these projects. While `mamou` is included in ToolShed, `lwasm` is the preferred assembler for modern development.
