	<tr><td>
		This is a very early compilation of technical reference documents
		for the MC6809, HT6309, Tandy Color Computer, Tano Dragon, and the
		Vectrex Home Arcade System. The primary focus of this collection
		is to provide a streamlined set of documents for assembly language
		programmers using either the CASM or CCASM cross-platform assemblers.<br>
		<br>
		The contents of this collection have been acquired over the years and
		have either been written by myself or others who have at one time
		or another been involved with a Motorola MC6809 based computer. I expect
		that as this collection grows and more information is added other
		MC6809 based systems will be included. I am hoping that in the near
		future arcade systems such as those for Ghosts and Goblins, Joust,
		and Defender which all use a MC6809 CPU will be added to the collection.<br>
		<br>
		The following people have in some way contributed to this collection:<br>
		<br>
		<ul>
			Alan Dekok - For maintaining the HT6309 Technical Reference all these years.<br>
			Ken Johnston for his "CoCo 3 Register Information" Guide<br>
			John Kowalski - Deluxe RS-232 register documentation.<br>
			Paul D. Burgin - For the information regarding the specifics of the Dragon.<br>
			William Barden Jr.; TRS-80 Color Computer Assembly Language Programming.<br>
			Tim Lindner for the Speech and Sound manual.<br>
